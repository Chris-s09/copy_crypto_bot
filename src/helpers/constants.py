General Information
The BOT ü§ñ is a software solution designed to interact with decentralized finance through copying
other addresses. It facilitates the automation of swaps.
By using this Bot, you acknowledge and accept the risks associated with DeFi activities.

No Financial Advice
The information and functionalities provided by this Bot are for informational and educational
purposes only. They do not constitute financial advice, investment recommendations, or an offer to
buy or sell any digital assets. Users should conduct their own research or consult with a professional
financial advisor before making any investment decisions.

Risk Acknowledgment
DeFi involves significant risks, including but not limited to market volatility, liquidity risks, and the
potential loss of your entire investment. The use of this Bot does not eliminate these risks. You
agree to use the Bot at your own risk, and you acknowledge that past performance is not indicative
of future results.

No Guarantee of Performance
While the Bot is designed to perform certain functions within the DeFi ecosystem, there is no
guarantee of performance, profitability, or any specific results. Market conditions can change
rapidly, and the Bot may not always perform as expected.
Generally speaking, please only use funds that you can afford to lose and always make sure to set
SL and TP orders!

These fees are used to ensure a smooth and secure service. A detailed percentage distribution of the fees to the respective areas can be found at www.YU.app

Security Risks
While the Bot implements security measures, the DeFi ecosystem is inherently vulnerable to
security breaches, including hacking, phishing, and other cyber threats. BOT ü§ñ does not guarantee
the security of the Bot or the safety of user funds. Users are responsible for implementing their own
security measures and practices.

Liability Limitation
BOT ü§ñ and its affiliates, partners, and developers shall not be liable for any direct, indirect,

or regulatory requirements.
